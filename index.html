    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>This roblox group is run by a solo indie developer who has too many time on their hands(subject to change however).</p>
    <p>I use this group to store robux and host games. However, in the future I might even host UGC on this group.</p>
    <h1>Word from the creator, @Auxilarist on roblox</h1>
    <p>"I have always sought after fun to play games that never really get repetitive or P2W. There are tons upon tons of games that are available in Roblox, 
        that are free-to-play and pretty much accessible in roblox. In recent years, however, some developers on Roblox are driven by money, whose names I won't 
        mention here. Many sucessful, front-page games are plagued by the same problem. Most of these games target kids, which is the prime demographic in Roblox. 
        Since kids have more freetime than their older counterparts, they can generate more money for the developer. Just like the brainrot situation on YouTube, 
        where many content farms ruin the reputation of many different types of media on the internet. I will not dive deeper into this topic about YouTube but it 
        is worth mentioning as the same thing is pretty much happening in Roblox too. Many popular, somewhat low effort, simple games with concepts easy-to-grasp and 
        more palatable themes and concepts overtake most high quality games(such as games like HELLMET and Centura which I consider to be works of art) only for the 
        reason that they appeal to a younger audience more.</p>
