        A general purpose ROBLOX group managed almost entirely by a single
        person used for hosting funds and games on ROBLOX.

    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
      This roblox group is run by a solo indie developer who has too many time
      on their hands(subject to change however). I use this group to store robux
      and host games. However, in the future I might even host UGC on this
      group.
    </p>
    <h1>Why does this website exist?</h1>
    <p>
      I created this website recently for a school project. Otherwise, this
      website is to be used as an information hub relating to this group.

          <h2>This group was created in 2023.</h2>
          <p>
            This group in particular was created to accommedate the then-brand
            new project "Project TrainCar2" in which I have already turned into
            a full ROBLOX game by now called "Trains vs Vehicles".

          <p>
            As of June 18th, 2025, there is 440 robux worth of funds hosted in
            this group. The highest it has ever been was at about 500 robux at
            September 2024, although 60 have been taken away due to group
            payouts. Most of the robux comes from donations and premium
            payouts(thanks!).

            As the 2nd most successful and second oldest game hosted in this
            group's name, this game is being actively developed by none other
            than the person who created this website. Trains Vs Vehicles will
            always be a solo project. Since I run on pure passion and willpower
            to update my games on a seemingly random schedule, please consider
            sharing or donating to me :)

            The most successful project ever hosted under the groups name is The
            Bunker Game.

          <p>
            This game has been established as early as December 12th, 2020. This
            game has even existed before the group itself! Over 4 years(as of
            the time i am writing this, which is June 18th, 2025), this game has
            been racking up a not-so-impressive 40.3K views. This is where most
            of the income flow comes from when it comes to group funds.
